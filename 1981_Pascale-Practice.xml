          <p> <date when="1981-01-27">January 26</date> <placeName corresp="places.xml#TOR">Toronto</placeName> Lynne Lake, the mother of two schoolchildren, reopened debate on
            sexual orientation bias at the Toronto Board of Education when she made an emotional
            plea to the schools programs committee. Lake demanded that the trustees rescind a motion
            passed September 18, 1980, which prohibited “bias on the basis of sex or sexual
            orientation,” and which specifically permitted “discussion of homosexuality” in schools.
            Lake also claimed that the NDP had been “exploiting the (gay) issue” and that gay
            activist John Argue, the chairman of the Metro Toronto NDP, had used political pressure
            to swing the vote in favour of the anti-discrimination motion. After some vigorous
            debate, the issue was referred to a special meeting of the full board of education to be
            held February 23, 1981. (See also February 23, 1981.) </p>

          <p> January–February Ottawa The Ottawa Children’s Aid Society (CAS) confirmed that it
          <!-- I'm the greatest -->  would consider placing children with homosexual foster parents, but only as a last
            resort. Preference was to be given to placing children in a “normalized setting,” with
            heterosexual parents. Roger Galipeau, president of GO, called the policy discriminatory

              discrimination against gays it had instituted in September 1980, by a vote of fourteen
              to twelve, and replaced them with more conservative ones. Thirty-eight speakers
              addressed the full board meeting, which lasted more than seven hours. The trustees voted
              twenty-two to four to outlaw discrimination against gays in the board’s employment
              practices only, and also agreed to allow discussion of homosexuality in schools but only

          <p> May 16–18 Vancouver More than 500 women participated in the fifth Bi-national Lesbian
            Conference, held at Langara College. The event drew women from across Canada to discuss
            priorities such as childcare, fighting the Right, and the formation of a national
            lesbian organization. There were plenary sessions, workshops, an art display (“Woman to
            Woman,” at the Women in Focus Gallery), and a dance featuring the lesbian rock band Mama
            Quilla II (with Lorraine Segato). More than 200 women marched in Canada’s first lesbian
            pride march, from Robson Square through downtown Vancouver to the WECC. A final report,
            Lesbian Power: Organizing for the 80s, was published after the conference. </p>
