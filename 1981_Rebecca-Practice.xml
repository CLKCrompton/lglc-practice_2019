          <p> July 3 New York, N.Y. The New York Times published an article by Lawrence K. Altman
            entitled “Rare Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals,” which was subsequently distributed
            internationally by the New York Times News Service. This was the first major mainstream
            newspaper article to discuss the health crisis that would eventually become known as the
            AIDS pandemic. An unnamed Body Politic reporter (likely Randy Coates and/or Bill Lewis)
            dismissed the report as being biased and riddled with errors. </p>
