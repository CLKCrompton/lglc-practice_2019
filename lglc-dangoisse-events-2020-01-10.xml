                     corresp="places.xml#">Los Angeles, CA, USA</placeName> Sidney Ross-Risden,
                  based in Los Angeles (CA, USA) writes to Wages Due Lesbians asking if they could
                  write a piece for the Lesbian News (in L.A.) Ruth (Hall?) respnded to use London's
                  Wage Due Lesbian piece from the andthology and their endorsement. From the looks
                  of the letter, Sidney knew Wages Due Lesbian very well, her tone is casual, she
                  gives some personal news and wants to hear about their news as well (Frances,
                  Ruth, and Judy are named). In the letter, Sidney also makes a reference to May Day
                  (1976?), a conference that was held at which a group from San Fransisco came, and
                  that a working relationship with the feminist Women's health center in L.A. may be
                  created out of the conference. They received some media coverage, one spot on
                  T.V., and an article in LA Opinion (a spanish speaking daily paper). One women
                  interviewed Ben and Susan (?) and they were asked to participate in some forums
                  for women in the Spanish community, on women's health. </p>

                     >Toronto, ON</placeName> Wages Due Lesbian, from Wages for Housework Women's
                  Centre in London, Ontario, writes to Wages Due Lesbians, Toronto faction about
                  sharing a speech Ellen A. has made at a public rally. They would like a copy of
                  the speech, and any other written things as they are themselves preparing a
                  lesbian insert for the family assitance petition and need some groundwork to work
                  with. They also ask about media coverage of the Toronto faction, as they are
                  thinking of holding a public meeting after May Day to gain media coverage. Wages
                  Due Lesbian - London, is also looking into writing a show called 'Judy and Judy',
                  about two neighbors tricking thei r husbands into finding time together - hinting
                  at a lesbian relationship but not openly. The letter also mentions that a song
                  needs to be written about lesbianism, the letter seem to request Boo do it. Also,
                  the London faction would like an update on whether or not the Toronto faction will
                  still hold a conference and day of workshops, waht they are planning for May Day
                  and what type of responses they have had from their door-to door petitioning. With
                  the letter, there are tapes as well that contain the discussion they had about the
                  recent National Lesbian Conference. Finally, WDL-London has left Kathy some badges </p>
